# ESPN-API
Miscellaneous Python Linux command line utilities to access the ESPN API

Most Linux distros have json & urllib libraries installed by default; if using another OS, double check. Use python3 -u to help reduce API caching.
Download .py file to your computer & use python3 to run:

Example Usage: python3 -u ESPNNFLAPIBoxScores.py YYYYMMDD

Date parameter is optional to select a specific date for the games. Due to API throttling, only 1 date is accepted (script if you require more).
