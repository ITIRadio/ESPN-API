# ESPN-API
Miscellaneous Python Linux command line utilities to access the ESPN API

Started as a Raspberry Pi ticker project, but because Python/Linux display options are far too limited, the Raspberry Pi ticker idea was abandoned, so these stats are dumped to the terminal for viewing or redirection.

Most Linux distros have json & urllib libraries installed by default; if using another OS, double check. Use python3 -u to help reduce API caching.
Download .py file to your computer & use python3 to run:

Example Usage: python3 -u ESPNNFLAPIBoxScores.py
